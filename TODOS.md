Currently, what we have done is just like a single drop of water in the ocean, there is a very lot of work todo.

In the current imagination, we need to do the following:

* Inject logger into the package
* Make a quick els + jaeger-client + jaeger-query + jaeger-collection start up for test usage
* Fill Documents
* And More Demo Usage
